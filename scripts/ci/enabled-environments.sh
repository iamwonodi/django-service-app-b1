# THE ENVIRONMENTS THIS PROJECT RUNS
#
# .github/environments.json lists the environments this app deploys to:
#
#   ["development", "production"]
#
# Any one, two or all three of development, staging and production, and only
# environments the service's infrastructure repository runs (there is nothing
# to deploy to elsewhere). Always in the platform's order, whatever the file's:
# a release reaches the first automatically, and each later one accepts only a
# tag that ran in the one before it.
#
# Usage:
#   enabled-environments.sh                   the list, as a JSON array, in order
#   enabled-environments.sh --check ENV       exit 0 if ENV is enabled, else explain and exit 1
#   enabled-environments.sh --filter JSON     the JSON array, keeping only enabled environments
#
#   ENVIRONMENTS_FILE  another file than <repository>/.github/environments.json (tests)
